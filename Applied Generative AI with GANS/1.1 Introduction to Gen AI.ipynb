    "### Agentic AI — The Next Evolution Beyond Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic AI refers to AI systems that do more than generate text or images—they can plan, reason, and act autonomously on tasks. Instead of simply answering prompts, they can execute multi-step workflows, make decisions, and interact with tools/apps with minimal human direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it matters ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Moves AI from being reactive (“respond when asked”) to proactive (“figure out and act on goals”)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected to be embedded into 40% of enterprise apps by 2026 — creating AI that manages tasks end-to-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents that schedule meetings, handle support tasks, or resolve customer issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems that monitor apps, discover issues, and fix them without human triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key trend:\n",
    "Multi-agent systems (collaboration between many AI agents) are reshaping enterprise workflows into autonomous orchestration networks rather than single-task tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Generative AI in the Cloud\n",

    "\n",
    "Domain-Specific Generative Models:\n",
    "Instead of huge general models, companies are building smaller, specialized models tailored to domains like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Healthcare\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Organizations will start to see AI moving from pilot projects to ROI-driven operational deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In creative industries, GenAI significantly accelerates workflows for content creation, design, and multimedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Cutting-Edge Examples & Products\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Cowork (Anthropic):\n",
    "A real example of agentic AI where multiple AI agents can work together to perform tasks like file analysis and task automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT Agents:\n",
    "Modern versions of ChatGPT include features that allow the model to plan and carry out multi-step tasks autonomously within controlled environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Language Models:\n",
    "New generation models (e.g., Google’s Gemini 3 and successors) integrate reasoning, multimodality, and broader agent support, enabling richer AI experiences beyond text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. What This Means for GenAI in 2026\n",
    "\n",
    "- Across research and enterprise arenas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generative AI is shifting from static generation to dynamic action.\n",
