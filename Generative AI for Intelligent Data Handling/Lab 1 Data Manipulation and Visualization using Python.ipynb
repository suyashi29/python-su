    "- Load the hotel booking dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. What is the shape of the dataset?\n",
    "- Print the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure. What are the column names and data types?\n",
    "- Check for missing values in the dataset. How many missing values are there in each column?\n",
    "- Explore some basic statistics of numerical features in the dataset. What are the mean, median, minimum, and maximum values of the 'lead_time' feature?\n",
    "- Explore some basic statistics of categorical features in the dataset. What are the unique values of the 'hotel' feature?\n",

    "- Impute missing values in numerical features using the mean strategy. How many missing values were imputed for each numerical feature?\n",

    "- Impute missing values in categorical features using the most frequent strategy. Which values were imputed for each categorical feature?\n",
    "- Convert categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables. How many new columns were added to the dataset after one-hot encoding?\n",
    "- Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler. What are the mean and standard deviation of the 'lead_time' feature after standardization?\n",

    "## Analysis:\n",
    "- Visualize the distribution of numerical features in the dataset. What insights can you gain from the visualizations?\n",
    "- How many unique hotels are there in data?\n",
    "- Create vizualtions to show reservation status.\n",
    "- Explore the relationship between the 'lead_time' and 'is_canceled' features using a scatter plot. Is there any apparent correlation between these two features?\n",
    "- Calculate the cancellation rate for each hotel. Which hotel has the highest cancellation rate?\n"
