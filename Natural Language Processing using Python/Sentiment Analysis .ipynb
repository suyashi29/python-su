    "### Title: Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Introduction\n",
    "   - Explanation of sentiment analysis.\n",
    "   - Importance of sentiment analysis in the movie industry.\n",
    "   - Objective of the case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data \n",
    "   - Sample movie reviews data attached \n",
    "   \n",
    "#### 3. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "   - Cleaning the text data (removing special characters, punctuation\n",
    "   - Tokenization: Breaking down the text into individual words or phrases.\n",
    "   - Removing stop words: Commonly occurring words that carry little or no meaning.\n",
    "   - Stemming or Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.\n",
    "   - Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical format using techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "   - Distribution of sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Word cloud visualization of most frequent words in positive and negative reviews.\n",
    "   - Analysis of review length distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Model Building\n",
    "   - Selection of machine learning or deep learning algorithms for sentiment analysis (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Recurrent Neural Networks).\n",
    "   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "   - Training the models on the training data.\n",
    "   - Evaluation of models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "   - Optimization of model performance by tuning hyperparameters.\n",
    "   - Using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Model Comparison and Selection\n",
    "   - Comparison of performance metrics for different models.\n",
    "   - Selection of the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.\n"
