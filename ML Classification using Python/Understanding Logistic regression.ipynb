    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It predicts **probabilities**, and based on those probabilities, it classifies data into categories like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hired (1) or Not Hired (0)**\n",
    "* Spam or Not Spam\n",
    "* Fraud or Not Fraud\n",
    "* Customer will churn or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the name contains “regression,” it is actually used for **classification**, not predicting continuous numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because many real-world problems require a **YES/NO decision**, not a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If a candidate has certain skills & experience → **Will they be hired?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression helps convert input features into a **probability score** between 0 and 1.\n",
    "If probability > 0.5 → predict **1**\n",

    "### **How Logistic Regression Works (Simple Explanation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: It first creates a **linear equation** like Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + b\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "z = 0.8(\\text{Experience}) + 1.5(\\text{SkillsScore}) - 5\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: That value **z** can be any number (positive or negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "But we want a **probability** between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So logistic regression uses the **Sigmoid Function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\n",
    "\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "This converts z → probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If z = 3 → sigmoid ≈ 0.95\n",
    "If z = –2 → sigmoid ≈ 0.12\n",

    "### **Why Sigmoid Function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it:\n",

    "✔ Squashes numbers between **0 and 1**\n",
    "✔ Acts like an S-shaped curve\n",
    "✔ Helps interpret results easily as probabilities\n",

    "```\n",
    "Probability(Hired) = 0.82\n",

    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “The candidate has an 82% chance of being hired.”\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is the Sigmoid Function?**\n",

    "(−∞ to +∞)\n",

    "\n",
    "* If sigmoid = 0.9 → 90% probability → class 1\n",
    "* If sigmoid = 0.2 → 20% probability → class 0\n",

    "#### **Intuition Behind Sigmoid**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s think of **z** as evidence for a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If evidence is strong positive → z is large → sigmoid → close to 1\n",
    "* If evidence is negative → z is small → sigmoid → close to 0\n",
    "* If evidence is unclear → z = 0 → sigmoid = 0.5\n",
